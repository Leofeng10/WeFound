# WeFound
## Introduction
### Motivation
Students, professors, staffs need to go to many different lecture theatres, canteens, offices on campus every day. It is quite common that one may lose their belongings somewhere and have difficulties finding them back. He may only imagine where he last sees it or just go to lost and founds counters to pray that someone finds it and brings it to the counter. People always have very limited information and clues that can help them find their items back, which always makes people struggled. 

However, if there is a platform for those who lose something or notice that something is left by others, it would be a different story. When people lose something and do not know what to do or where to find it, they may first post their lost items on the platform, and they can also go through the found list to see if their items have been found by others. Moreover, if you find a wallet under a chair in the lecture theatre or a student card on the soccer field, you may post the information on the platform, to help those who are extremely anxious and want to find their losses back.
### Aim
We hope to help the owner of the lost property find their items easily and quickly by providing them a platform that collects information. By using the app-based platform, they could get more information and luckily they may find their loss has been posted by on the platform, and then can get it back by following detailed information provided by finders.
